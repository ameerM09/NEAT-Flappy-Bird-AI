# NEAT-Flappy-Bird-AI

## Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies

Uses the NEAT module of Python to teach an AI how to play the game Flappy Bird.  

This project invovled having a set of birds gather certain input to then move randomly on the screen.

Eventually, when this set of the birds died out, the birds with the best fitness (having made it past the most obstacles) were bred for the next generation.

This goes on until the AI has the perfect output to overcome each game obstacle.
